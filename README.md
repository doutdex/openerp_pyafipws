In Accounting, Configuration, Financial Accounting, Journals, 
create a new jornal for electronic invoices it and tab "Argentina Afip WebServices":
 * Select the webservice (home market, exports, etc)
 * Select the invoice type (A: general regime, B: final consumer C: exempt / monotributo, E: exports)
 * Complete the point of sale prefix (anyone for testing, register one at AFIP for production). 
 * Test them ussing the buttons "Dummy", "Verificar" (verify) y "Obtener Ãºlt.nro." (get last invoice number)
 * Remember that the sequence numeration must match AFIP (starts at 1).

If everything went ok, you should see the tab "Factura Electronica Argentina" in Accounting, Customers, Invoices.
By default, invoice type will be 1 (products), you can select 2 (services) and complete the billing period dates.
When you click Validate to pass from draft to open, it will call AFIP and complete the result field, 
CAE (electronico invoice autorization number), CAE due date and messages.

For testing you don't need to change the system setting. 
For production you must set:

 * pyafipws.wsaa.url = https://wsaa.afip.gov.ar/ws/services/LoginCms?wsdl
 * pyafipws.wsfe.url = https://servicios1.afip.gov.ar/wsfev1/service.asmx?WSDL
 * pyafipws.wsfex.url = https://servicios1.afip.gov.ar/wsfexv1/service.asmx?WSDL

Optionally, create a temporary cache folder (i.a. /tmp/cache), give openerp write permissions
and configure system parameter pyafipws.cache = /tmp/cache
If you use special proxy servers (ISA), you would need to install pycurl 
and configure pyafipws.proxy system parameter accordingly.
